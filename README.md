# Calculator

This was a project assigned through The Odin Project. The goal was to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic functioning calculator.
The most challenging part of the assigment was implementing the actual mathematical functions, the order of operations in particular. Once that
was solved, however, it was fairly straightforward. 

I intend to revisit this project with a deeper understanding of CSS in order to clean up the UI and to make it look like something that a person
might actually want to use.
